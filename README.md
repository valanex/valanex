            <p>This virtual pet game is my first non-tutorial solo project. It was built for assessment to join the Chingu Voyage 41 collaborative project.</p>
            This project involved understanding of:
            <ul>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Fetch API</li>
                <li>setTimeout()</li>
                <li>Bootstrap-React</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More details about the game itself are available in the <a href="https://github.com/valanex/virtual-meow">GitHub repo</a>. </p>

        <p><strong>1. The specifications</strong></p>
        <p>This project idea was fun, but Chingu was also very specific in what the app needed to have. I wasn't sure how to build all the functions, but I was confident they were buildable. </p>
        <p>You can find the specifications on the

        <p><strong>2. Creating GIF sprites</strong></p>
        <p>Knowing that this would disrupt my momentum later, it was best to begin with the sprites. From the start I envisioned a pixelated cat. I drew one on <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a> and created 3 versions: happy, sad, and <i>*cough*</i> dead <i>*cough*</i>.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Wireframe</strong></p>
        <p>I drew my wireframe on paper because I forgot I had an iPad.</p>
        <p>The purpose was to make sure I adhered to Chingu's requirements and to decide how to display it all in a comfortably compact interface.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Further UI design</strong></p>
        <p>Now it was time to see how it looked in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>! This gave me dimensions to work with, and showed just how limited space would be.</p> 
        <p>The colors didn't look great, but that could be fixed later.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Planning the build</strong></p>
        <p>To make it less confusing during the coding process, I typed out the order in which I thought the features and functionality should be built. The list became more detailed as I was coding and really helped break down the complexities into manageable chunks.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Coding</strong></p>
        <p>This took about 10 days overall. I got stuck on how to implement in-game time and then how to stop it counting from day 0 up to day <tt>n</tt> during every in-game day. It turns out that <tt>setTimeout()</tt> is a better choice than <tt>setInterval()</tt>. Overlapping timers was also a multi-day headache.</p> 
        <p>I was pushing commits to GitHub at each step in my list.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Final touches</strong></p>
        <p>After writing my first decent ReadMe, my first thought was that my game was too ugly to deploy. To add a bit of flair, I implemented some visual improvements for a more polished look.</p>
        <p>Overall, I'm very proud to have built a React app without tutorials! I'm prouder still that Chingu has reviewed and accepted my submission, allowing me to join a collaborative project for Voyage 41.</p>
